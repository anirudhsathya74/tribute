                The 2019â€“2020 coronavirus pandemic is upending life on a global level as we know it. The highly
                infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
                coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first seen in Wuhan, Hubei, China where its outbreak was first
                identified in December 2019. After almost 3 months, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization
                recognized it as a pandemic considering its significant ongoing spread in multiple countries across the
                world.

                Doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly
                infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing
                unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical
                cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight
                against coronavirus, <q><b>the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and
                        ventilators as their weapons</b></q>. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and
                night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease.
                <hr>

                Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of
                healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that,
                many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.
                <hr>

                Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting
                themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and
                welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end. Most importantly, we must
                reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us.
                Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find
                ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient medical fraternity and give medical
                professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly deserve once this crisis is
                over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and technology. Nothing
                will be a greater tribute to the health-care workers than this.
                <hr>

                That being said, we'd now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors
                from across the globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of COVID-19 patients.
